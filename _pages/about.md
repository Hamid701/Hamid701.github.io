## Introduction:

Welcome to my data science portfolio. I’m a data scientist, researcher, and former mathematics educator passionate about uncovering patterns in complex systems and solving real-world problems. My journey blends advanced academic training with practical applications, bridging the gap between theory and actionable insights.

## My Journey: 

My academic foundation began with a Master’s in Mathematics and Applications, where I graduated at the top of my class. Driven by a curiosity for applied mathematics and its potential to solve real-world challenges, I pursued a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Deep Learning at Mohammed V University.

During my four years in the Ph.D. program, I conducted research in time series forecasting and deep learning models for solar energy predictions. My work focused on developing and optimizing artificial neural networks, achieving significant improvements in forecasting accuracy. This research has direct implications for sustainable energy management and renewable energy systems.
While I ultimately decided to transition out of the program to pursue applied roles in data science and machine learning, my time in the Ph.D. program equipped me with advanced skills in:

- **Machine Learning & AI**: Building and deploying models to solve complex problems.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicting future trends with precision.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Transforming raw data into actionable insights.
- **Research & Problem-Solving**: Tackling open-ended challenges with creativity and curiosity.

## Beyond the Algorithms:

As Freeman Dyson once described, thinkers can be classified as "birds" (who see broad connections) or "frogs" (who dive deep into details). I consider myself a "would-be bird", constantly seeking the bigger picture in the vast landscape of data and knowledge. I am fascinated by the philosophical foundations of AI and mathematics. I often ponder questions such as: What makes an algorithm truly "intelligent"? Can mathematical models ever fully capture the complexity of human decision-making? How does data science shape our understanding
of uncertainty and prediction?

## My work:

- Published peer-reviewed research on artificial neural networks for solar energy forecasting.
- Developed Transformer-based models that significantly improved forecasting accuracy.
- Contributed to advancing methodologies in renewable energy predictions.
